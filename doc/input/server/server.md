# About Modbus Server {#sec_server_about}

The server implements Modbus server device and works like Modbus simulator. 
However, the server can  not only simulate single device, but can simulate
several devices that can be connected to a single network,
which is especially useful when working with RTU and ASCII protocols,
when access to all Modbus servers is realized through a single serial port.
However, it can also be useful to simulate Modbus network using the 
TCP version of the protocol, for example, if you use the TCP->RTU bridge,
Modbus server can replace this bridge with remote devices for testing purposes.

All work is performed within a single project.
The main entities in the project are Port, Device, DataViewItem and Action.
Port contains network settings for both TCP/IP and serial ports.
Device contains settings for a single device 
(such as Modbus Unit Address, memory size etc).  
The DataViewItem contains a single data unit to be read/write from the device and has many formats to represent 
the current data. Action provides simulation capabilities (automatic change of device memory values).

Since v0.4 version `server` application allows to extend logic of your Modbus device 
simulator using one the most popular programming language - Python.
All you need to use scripting is installed Python interpreter and `PyQt5` library.

# Quickstart {#sec_server_quickstart}

![](server_view.png)

To start working with the program, you need to run `server.exe`. Then, by default, when you first start the program, 
an empty project is created, consisting of a single port, a device attached to it.

## Port {#sec_server_quickstart_port}

To change the port settings, you should double-click on the port name in the project tree 
or use the menu `Port->Edit Port...`). 
The port must be selected in the project tree.  To add a new port, select `Port->New Port...`

![](server_port_dialog.png)

In this dialog box, you can set the network settings for the port.

## Device {#sec_server_quickstart_device}

To change the device settings you need to double click left mouse button on the device name in the project tree 
(or use the menu `Device->Edit Device...`). The device must be selected in the project tree. 
To add a new device, select `Device->New Device...` or `Port->New Device...` to immediately bind this device 
to the selected port or use `New Device` toolbar menu.
In ProjectView in `[]`-brackets there are references (unit address) to this device in port context. 
Single device can be bind to several ports using this reference and
each port can have different reference(s) to this device. 
To edit this reference(s) select `Port->Edit Device...` (reference must be selected in `ProjectView`). 
To add existing device to selected port click `Port->Add Existing...`

![](server_device_dialog.png)

In this dialog box, you can set the device settings, such as device name and different memory blocks size.

## DataView {#sec_server_quickstart_dataview}

To add new DataView List click `Data->New Data View...`. In this window you can set name and refresh period.

![](server_dataview_dialog.png)

To add items to the view, you can use the menu `Data->New Item(s)...` or press the `Insert` key.

![](server_dataviewitem_dialog.png)

In this window, you can select all the data parameters to be added to the project, 
such as the device to which the data relates, address, format, and number of such data elements. 
The addresses of the following elements will be automatically calculated as you add them. 
Data parameters can be edited individually directly in the DataView list.

## Runtime {#sec_server_quickstart_runtime}

To start the process of accepting remote Modbus requests, click `Run` on the tool bar  (or the menu `Runtime->Run`).
After starting the system, project adding/removing ports and devices is not available. 
DataView lists and items can be add and delete at runtime. Device parameters can be edited at runtime.

After you have finished working with the project, you can save it using `File->Save` or `File->Save As...`.

# Graphical User Interface {#sec_server_gui}

![](server_gui_schema.png)

The graphical interface consists of the following main elements:
* `Project View` - a project window that displays the structure of the project,
consisting of such nodes as `Port` and `Device`
* `Device View(s)` – view full memory content of the single device
* `Data View(s)` - lists of data to be read/write
* `Script Window` - editor's window(s) to create/edit script source
* `Simulation View` – list of simulation items, items that change device memory automatically
* `LogView` - a window for displaying information
* `Output` - a window for script standard output

* `Tool bar` - access to the most frequently used commands
* `Status bar` - the current status of the program

## Project window {#sec_server_gui_project}

![](server_project_window.png)

It displays the network settings for this project, i.e., the ports (Port) through which the exchange with current 
Modbus devices takes place. Many Modbus devices can be specified for one port, so you can not only use 
a single device in the Modbus network, 
but also organize an exchange with all devices that are in the same network. 
There can also be several such networks in one project.

Single device can be bind to various ports using reference (unit address). It’s displayed in square brackets. 
For instance PLC1 belongs to Port (RTU) using units from 1 to 10 and 255.
And the same device is using in Port1 with unit 1 
(`[]`-view can be managed using `Tools->Settings->View->Use Port/Device name with settings`).

# Scripting

`server` application gives you access to the device's internal Modbus memory and
provides `Output` window where standard output is redirected.
The rest is the power of Python, its standard library, 3rd party libraries,
and your own libraries and scripts.

__*New in version 0.4.5*__:
> Starting with the version oldest supported Python interpreter is `Python 3.6`.

Every device has its own set of scripts: `Init`, `Loop` and `Final`.
Those scripts accessable through device menu or contex menu for device.

![](server_scripting.png)

`Init` script performs once at program start (when push `Start` button).
It intended for making python `import` instruction, create objects, files etc.
Modules, objects and files created within will be accessable from `Loop` and `Final` scripts.

`Loop` script performs cyclic until program not stopped.
It has implicit cycle so user don't have to cycle his program manualy.

`Final` script performs once at program stop (when push `Stop` button).
It intended for release resources previously created in `Init` and `Loop` scripts, save files etc.

Standard global objects for access corresponding device memory and its types: 
* `mem0x` (`mbserver._MemoryBlockBits`)
* `mem1x` (`mbserver._MemoryBlockBits`)
* `mem3x` (`mbserver._MemoryBlockRegs`)
* `mem4x` (`mbserver._MemoryBlockRegs`)

Every object has set of get/set function to work with different data types:
 * `mem0x`, `mem1x`: `get<datatype>(bitoffset:int)->int` and `set<datatype>(bitoffset:int,value:int)`
 * `mem3x`, `mem4x`: `get<datatype>(regoffset:int)->int` and `set<datatype>(regoffset:int,value:int)`

`<datatype>`: `int8`, `uint8`, `int16`, `uint16`, `int32`, `uint32`, `int64`, `uint64`, `float`, `double`.

Examples:
```python
v = mem0x.getint8(0)
mem1x.setint16(1, -1)
mem3x.setuint16(0, 65535)
mem4x.setdouble(10, 2.71828)
```

Also index operation is supported.
In case of discrete memory (`mem0x`, `mem1x`) it work with `boolean` values
and for registers memory (`mem3x`, `mem4x`) it work with `uint16` values:

```python
b0 = mem0x[0]
mem1x[38] = True
mem3x[100] = 65535
if mem4x[0] > 32768:
    mem4x[0] = 0 
```

Scripting gives you access into current device settings by global object `mbdevice`
which has type `mbserver._MbDevice`. Example of usage:

```python
print("Device name is " + mbdevice.getname())
print("Device exception status is " + hex(mbdevice.getexcstatus()))
print("Device count of coils is " + hex(mbdevice.getcount0x()))
print("Device count of discrete inputs is " + hex(mbdevice.getcount1x()))
print("Device count of input registers is " + hex(mbdevice.getcount3x()))
print("Device count of holding registers is " + hex(mbdevice.getcount4x()))
```

Also `mem0x`, `mem1x`, `mem3x`, `mem4x` can be accessed through `mbdevice` object:

```python
new_mem0x_ref = mbdevice.getmem0x()
new_mem1x_ref = mbdevice.getmem1x()
new_mem3x_ref = mbdevice.getmem3x()
new_mem4x_ref = mbdevice.getmem4x()
```

## Python `import` directories

You can use Python modules, e.g. in case of big simulation projects.
Or maybe you want to use your own Python modules for different devices within
single project or for different projects.

By default server add directory `<your_bin_folder>/script/server` into import path.

Also current folder (where `*.pjs` project file is located) is added into import path.

## Script Modules (v0.4.3)

Starting with version `v0.4.3` server supports built-in script modules
which have the same functionality as regular python file-separated-modules,
but can be packed within the single project file and
distributed as single integrated project.

![](server_scriptmodule_window.png)

When project is start running this script module is generated as separated file
within same folder in which regular script files for project devices is located.
